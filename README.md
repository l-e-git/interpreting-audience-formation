This repository contains a short exploratory data analysis examining how track-level popularity is distributed across selected jazz
and classical artists. We use Spotify API data

The analysis, along with more detailed commentary, is contained in the Jupyter notebook in `notebooks/`.

Data collected from the Spotify API during the analysis is in `data/`.

There is more to be done here - this is just a sketch.
